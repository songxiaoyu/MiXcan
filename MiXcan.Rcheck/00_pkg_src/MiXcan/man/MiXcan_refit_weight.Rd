\title{Un-penalized weights for MiXcan selected SNPs}
\usage{
MiXcan_refit_weight(model, x, y, cov, pi, keepZeroWeight = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A direct output from MiXcan() function, which includes the
prediction weights as well as other summaries of the prediction models.}

\item{y:}{The pre-cleaned expression level data for a single gene in N samples.}

\item{x:}{A N by P matrix for all the genetic predictors used to predict the genetically regulated expression  of the gene.}

\item{cov:}{A N by Q matrix for the covariates adjusted in the model (e.g. age, population stratification).}

\item{pi:}{An estimation of cell-type faction of the cell type of interest (e.g.
epithelial). It can be estimated using existing methods
in the literature or from the output of pi_estimation function.}

\item{keepZeroWeight:}{Whether to keep predictors with zero weights.}
}
\value{
A data frame with weight for cell 1 and 2, including the potential meta data for the SNP/gene.
}
\description{
Refit MiXcan selected SNPs to  ordinary least square for un-penalized weights.
