\title{Extract the gene expression prediction weights matrix}
\usage{
MiXcan_extract_weight(model, keepZeroWeight = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A direct output from MiXcan() function, which includes the
prediction weights as well as other summaries of the prediction models.}

\item{keepZeroWeight}{Default=F. Whether to keep SNPs that have zero weights in all cell types.}
}
\value{
A data frame with weight for cell 1 and 2, including the potential meta data for the SNP/gene.
}
\description{
Extract the gene expression prediction weights matrix (elastic net regression coefficients) from MiXcan() function.
The output can be directly applied to GWAS data for cell-type specific TWAS.
