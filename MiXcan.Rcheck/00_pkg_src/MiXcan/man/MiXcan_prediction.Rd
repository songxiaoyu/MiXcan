\title{Predict the cell-type specific or non-specific expression levels of a gene with MiXcan model in new genetic data.}
\usage{
MiXcan_prediction(weight, new_x)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight}{Weight matrix produced by MiXcan_extract_weight()}

\item{new_x}{The genetic data used for prediction in a new data set.}
}
\value{
A N by 2 matrix indicating the predicted gene expression levels in two
cell types. If a non-specific model is used for prediction, the predicted values should be the same in two cell types.
}
