#' Extract the gene expression prediction weights matrix
#'
#' Extract the gene expression prediction weights matrix (elastic net regression coefficients) from MiXcan() function.
#' The output can be directly applied to GWAS data for cell-type specific TWAS.
#'
#' @param model A direct output from MiXcan() function, which includes the
#' prediction weights as well as other summaries of the prediction models.
#' @param keepZeroWeight Default=F. Whether to keep SNPs that have zero weights in all cell types.
#'
#' @return A data frame with weight for cell 1 and 2, including the potential meta data for the SNP/gene.
#' @export
