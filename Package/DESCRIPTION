Title: Cell-type-Aware Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies with Bulk Tissue Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Xiaoyu Song
Maintainer: The package maintainer <xiaoyu.song@mountsinai.org>
Description: The goal of MiXcan is to construct cell-type-level gene expression prediction models (cell-type-specific or nonspecific), apply these models to predict cell-type-level genetically regulated expression in new data, and perform cell-type-aware transcriptome-wide association studies.
